Sea levels will rise in some coastal areas. There will be heat-waves and more air pollution, which in turn will cause infectious diseases to spread. There will, however, be some benefits, too. Moderate warming will favor some farmers. Some areas will have more water and more sunshine. There are ways of attempting to slow climate change, such as replanting and increasing the area of the world’s forests, because plants and trees reduce the effects of carbon dioxide, but on its own this is not enough to stop global warming. For this to happen, we must cut down on our production of carbon dioxide. One way to do this is to cut down on our use of fossil fuels like coal and oil, which is possible but must be done gradually: coal and oil can be replaced over a period of time by wind energy and solar power. Climate change is not entirely new; it happened two hundred years ago when the Industrial Revolution started. In recent years, the United States has been responsible for 25% of greenhouse gas emissions. In the future, India and China will produce more greenhouse gases than the United States and Europe."
