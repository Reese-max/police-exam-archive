Chairs are lined up in straight rows facing the teacher’s desk or lectern. In one study, over 80% of university students rated their classrooms negatively, describing them as ugly, cramped, stuffy, and uncomfortable.The research byenvironmental psychologists is beginning to show that unattractive classrooms are not only unappealing; they may also adversely affect academicperformance. A more carefully controlled study of classroom environments was conducted a few years ago. The researchers selected two identical classrooms located side by side in the psychology building. The control classroom,whichtheycalledthe“sterileclassroom,”hadwhitewalls,agraycarpet,androwsofplasticdesks. Besides,analcohol-basedbeautifulhandsanitizerwasplacedintheroomforstudentstouse.Theexperimental classroom, which they called the “friendly classroom,” was redecorated with the help of a design consultant. Several walls were painted bright colors, art posters hung on the walls, large plants added to the room, and colorful Chinese kites hung from the ceiling. In addition to traditional desks, a part of the room was outfitted witharea rugs, color-coordinatedcushions, andwoodencubes toprovidenontraditional seating.
