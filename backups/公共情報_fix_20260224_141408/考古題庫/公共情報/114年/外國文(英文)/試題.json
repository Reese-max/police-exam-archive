Its main\nproblem is not technology, but scale. China controls 80% of the global\ndrone market, which means it can produce drones very cheaply. The non-\nred drones Coretronic makes cost about 25% more than their equivalent in\nChina.

That may be one reason many unsafe older drivers continue to\ndrive despite failing driving skills. Balancing public safety with seniors’\nindependence is a complex issue. For many older adults, driving is\nessential for staying active, running errands, attending social events,\nvisiting loved ones, and maintaining control over their daily routines.\nIn your opinion, when should seniors stop driving, and who should make that\ndecision?\nWrite a short essay of approximately 250 words explaining your\nperspective.

        "D": "Put aStoptoMicrobeads 請依下文回答第36題至第40題 The impact of artificial intelligence on employment is a prominent topic, as highlighted by a sign reading “Stop Hiring Humans” at an AI conference, reflecting the unease surrounding new AI models. Artisan, a startup, exemplifies this shift byoffering AI agents like Ava, virtual sales representatives that can identify leads, contact customers, write emails, and schedule appointments, costing 96 percent less thanhumanequivalents. This development is part of the generative AI trend that began with ChatGPT in 2022, where AI increasinglymakes decisions traditionallymadebyhumans. WhileArtisan,oneofthekeyplayers inthis field, is upfront about the possibility of AI replacing certain jobs, many other generative AI companies takeamorecautious stance.Thesecompanies arguethat ratherthan replacingworkers, AIwill primarily serve as a tool to enhance human capabilities, allowingindividuals to perform their jobs more efficiently andcreatively.
