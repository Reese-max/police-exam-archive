Often it is more convenient to 11 at two or more tables of six or more persons. The advantage of this arrangement is that it affords more places of honor as the host and hostess can each have a co-hostess and cohost at their 12 tables.

More than half of the people in Vancouver do not speak English as their first language. Almost 30% of the city’s inhabitants are of Chinese heritage. In the 1980s, an influx of immigrants from Hong Kong in anticipation of the transfer of sovereignty from the United Kingdom to China, combined with an increase in immigrants from mainland China and previous immigrants from Taiwan, established in Vancouver one of the highest concentrations of ethnic Chinese residents in North America. This arrival of Asian immigrants continued a tradition of immigration from around the world that had established Vancouver as the second-most popular destination for immigrants in Canada after Toronto. Other significant Asian ethnic groups in Vancouver are Filipino, Japanese, Korean, as well as sizeable communities of Vietnamese, Indonesians, and Cambodians. Despite increases in Latin American immigration to Vancouver in the 1980s and '90s, recent immigration has been comparatively low, and African immigration has been similarly stagnant. The black population of Vancouver is rather scant in comparison to other Canadian major cities. The neighborhood of Strathcona was the core of the city’s Jewish community. Hogan’s Alley, a small area adjacent to Chinatown, just off Main Street at Prior, was once home to a significant black community. Prior to the Hong Kong diaspora of the 1990s, the largest non-British ethnic groups in the city were Irish and German, followed by Scandinavian, Italian, Ukrainian and Chinese. From the mid-1950s until the 1980s, many Portuguese immigrants came to Vancouver and the city had the third-largest Portuguese population in Canada in 2001. Eastern Europeans began immigrating after the Soviet takeover of Eastern Europe after World War II. Greek immigration increased in the late 1960s and early '70s, with most settling in the Kitsilano area.",
