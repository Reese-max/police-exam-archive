Le ministère a également fait savoir que le passage de cette\nloi marquait une étape importante dans les efforts du gouvernement pour\nattirer et retenir les talents internationaux.\nEn vertu de cette loi, les permis de travail et de résidence des\nprofessionnels étrangers qualifiés seront étendus de trois années maximum\nactuellement à cinq, avec des prolongations pouvant aller jusqu'à cinq ans\naprès l'expiration.\nLes professionnels étrangers pourront également solliciter une carte de\ntravail Or (Employement Gold Card) quatre-en-un, qui comprendra un\npermis de travail, un visa de résident, un certificat de résident étranger\n(ARC) et un permis d'entrées multiples. Cette carte sera valable entre un et\ntrois ans. D'après le conseil, cela donnera plus de liberté aux ressortissants\nétrangers qui ne dépendront alors plus de leurs employeurs pour faire leurs\ndemandes de permis de travail.\nCette loi fera également disparaître l'obligation pour les étrangers de\nrésider au moins 183 jours sur le territoire pour pouvoir conserver le statut de\nleur ARC ou de leur permis de résidence permanente (APRC). En outre, les\nprofessionnels étrangers qui travaillent comme artistes pourront candidater\ndirectement auprès du ministère du Travail pour obtenir leur permis au lieu\nde passer par un employeur.\nEn ce qui concerne les personnes à charge, les épouses et les enfants\nmineurs des professionnels étrangers n'auront plus besoin d'attendre six mois\navant de pouvoir demander d'être couverts par le programme de l'Assurance\nsanté nationale. La nouvelle loi stipule que les personnes à charge des\nprofessionnels étrangers comme les épouses, les enfants mineurs et les\nenfants handicapés pourront avoir accès à une autorisation de résidence\npermanente à Taiwan (APRC).",

The law was intended to protect immigrants from Commonwealth nations, especially former colonies in the Caribbean, India, and Pakistan. The first of these immigrants, 492 Jamaicans, had arrived 20 years earlier. Hundreds of thousands followed. \"The immigrants were called over,\" says Sathnam Sanghera, an author whose Sikh parents emigrated from India during that time. \"There was a labor shortage. There weren't enough people to run the factories after the war.\" The immigrants were granted British citizenship and helped rebuild Britain after World War II. But they faced racism. Landlords wouldn't rent to them. Some employers turned them away. The Race Relations Act was intended to protect immigrants. The tension was especially obvious in Wolverhampton, one of the first cities in Britain to experience mass immigration. Enoch Powell, who represented Wolverhampton in Parliament, feared a race war coming because of mass immigration. On April 20, 1968, he took the stage at a Conservative Party event at the Midlands Hotel in Birmingham and gave an incendiary speech that would come to define him — and divide his country. In the speech, Powell warned, \"that tragic and intractable phenomenon which we watch with horror on the other side of the Atlantic ... is coming upon us here by our own volition and our own neglect.\" He attacked the bill that outlawed discrimination. He said it was whites who were facing deprivation and that Britain \"must be mad, literally mad, as a nation to be permitting\" large numbers of immigrants to enter. The Times of London immediately labeled it an \"evil speech.\" Conservative Party leader Edward Heath dismissed Powell from the party leadership. But polls showed a majority of Britons supported Powell. Many protested, saying, \"Powell was right.\" The speech emboldened racists."
