Selon\nla déclaration publiée au terme de la rencontre, les ministres ont aussi accepté d’informer\nles migrants des risques liés à la migration illégale et de la possibilité qu’ils puissent\nvolontairement retourner à la maison.\nLes ministres se sont concentrés sur le cas de la Libye, puisque selon le ministre\nfrançais de l’Intérieur, Gérard Collomb, 95 pour cent des migrants qui traversent la mer\npour aller en Europe partent de ce pays. M. Collomb a souligné la nécessité d’établir un\ngouvernement stable en Libye pour mieux contrôler l’afflux de migrants en Europe.\nDans les premiers mois de l’année 2017, près de  migrants sont arrivés en Italie\npar la mer, une augmentation de 20 pour cent par rapport à la même période l’année\ndernière. Plus de 2200 autres ont perdu la vie dans leur dangereuse traversée, selon\nl’Organisation internationale pour les migrations.\nLa déclaration finale de la rencontre indique en outre qu’un «engagement mondial» est\nnécessaire pour faire face à la crise. «Il n’y a pas de solution magique. Aucun pays ne peut,\nà lui seul, gérer l’afflux de migrants et aucun pays n’est à l’abri», a déclaré le ministre\nitalien, Marco Minniti.",
