One type involves physical activity and its demands; the other type is the result of mental and emotional demands. Whether physical or emotional in origin,stress causes thebodytoreact insimilarways. Inthe first stage, your bodyprepares tomeet thestress. The heartbeat and respiration rates increase, and the pupils of the eyes dilate; the blood sugar level increases, and the perspiration rate speeds up, while digestion slows down as blood and muscular activity is diverted elsewhere. In the second stage, your body returns to normal and repairs any damage caused by the stressful situation. However, if stress continues, the body cannot repair itself, and the final stage, exhaustion, then begins. If this stage continues, physical and emotional damage will occur. These stages of stress reaction are generallythesame,whetherthestressiscausedbyacross-countryrun,afirstdate,buyingahouse,ornarrowly missinganautomobileaccident. Stress from physical activity, if not carried too far, is actually beneficial. Probably most harmful of all stresses is guilt. This common emotion is useful to have when it helps us realize that we have, in fact, committed some error, violated our own rules or social norms. If we did not feel guilt, we would never do anythingexceptthethingsthatbroughtusimmediatepleasure—we’dneverobeythelaw,work,orevenstudy inschool,unlesswewantedtodosointhefirstplace.Asaperson’sconsciencedevelops,guiltfeelingsbecome inevitable; guilt is thesorrowwe experiencewhen weknowwehavedonesomethingincorrect. Many of us as children learned rules that we no longer need. For instance, a successful business person needs not feel guilty about spending a little too much money on a vacation, or should she/he feel guilty that she/hecan combineabusiness tripwithsomeswimmingand golfat anoceanresort. But manypeopledofeel guilty over such apparently innocent actions. Excessive guilt can make life not worth living; guilt can cause self-hatredas well as otherfears and anxieties that causeall life’s successes tobebittersweet,at best. Guilt and the worrythat often accompanies this major stress are difficult to eradicate, but people subject to excessive guilt feelings should realize, as simple as it sounds, that no one is perfect. People cannot always be cheerful and helpful to everyone they meet. Another good lesson is that mistakes should be forgotten, not lingeredover andbrought out toexamineperiodically. Alifewithoutstresswouldbeboring.Justasweneedalittleguilttokeepuscorrect,andalittleworryto make us plan ahead, we need a little stress to stay interested in life. But, when stress begins to bother you, change your routine. Take your mind off your worries with some activities, whether tennis, yoga, gardening, or meditation. Or talk your worries over with someone else; you maydiscover a solution you had overlooked before."
