На самом деле всё начинается ещё с пересечения границы! Там\nпограничники выдают иностранцу для заполнения миграционную\nкарту. Миграционная карта, в первую очередь, отражает сведения об\nиностранце. Благодаря данной карте госорганы отслеживают его\nпребывание в РФ.\nВАЖНО! Если Вы собираетесь в последующем трудоустраиваться\nв РФ, Вам обязательно нужно выделить цель въезда «работа». Выбрав\nдругую цель, Вы не сможете оформить необходимые для работы\nразрешительные документы.\nСегодня Тайвань считается одним из мировых лидеров в сфере выпуска\nвысокотехнологической продукции. Сельскохозяйственная отрасль уже\nмного лет не является приоритетным источником наполнения бюджета,\nхотя по-прежнему важна. В стране развивается информационная\nиндустрия, нефтехимия, биотехнология, металлургия, машиностроение,\nтекстильная промышленность, финансовый рынок, туризм и в целом\nсфера услуг.\nПрактически в каждом из вышеперечисленных направлений\nнайдётся работа для русских, украинцев, белорусов и других\nиностранцев в 2018 году. Кроме того, в страну приходит большое\nколичество зарубежных инвестиций и функционирует множество\nмеждународных компаний.

The law was intended to protect immigrants from Commonwealth nations, especially former colonies in the Caribbean, India, and Pakistan. The first of these immigrants, 492 Jamaicans, had arrived 20 years earlier. Hundreds of thousands followed. \"The immigrants were called over,\" says Sathnam Sanghera, an author whose Sikh parents emigrated from India during that time. \"There was a labor shortage.

Landlords wouldn't rent to them. Some employers turned them away. The Race Relations Act was intended to protect immigrants. The tension was especially obvious in Wolverhampton, one of the first cities in Britain to experience mass immigration. Enoch Powell, who represented Wolverhampton in Parliament, feared a race war coming because of mass immigration. On April 20, 1968, he took the stage at a Conservative Party event at the Midlands Hotel in Birmingham and gave an incendiary speech that would come to define him — and divide his country. In the speech, Powell warned, \"that tragic and intractable phenomenon which we watch with horror on the other side of the Atlantic ... is coming upon us here by our own volition and our own neglect.\" He attacked the bill that outlawed discrimination. He said it was whites who were facing deprivation and that Britain \"must be mad, literally mad, as a nation to be permitting\" large numbers of immigrants to enter. The Times of London immediately labeled it an \"evil speech.\" Conservative Party leader Edward Heath dismissed Powell from the party leadership. But polls showed a majority of Britons supported Powell. Many protested, saying, \"Powell was right.\" The speech emboldened racists.",
