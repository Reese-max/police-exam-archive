Начальник\nпограничного ведомства отметил, что если миграционные потоки\nизменят направление на север, то Эстония окажется на пути следования\nнелегалов, и поэтому в департаменте полиции и погранохране Эстонии\nпринимают меры, чтобы нелегально попасть в Эстонию было сложно.\nЭти меры касаются не только ограждения, но и всего мониторингового\nоборудования.

Unfortunately, producers tend to stick to the same few archetypes and tropes. Nearly every showabouthighschoolersincludesatoughjockorarebelliousbadboy.Assuch,itisnosurprisethattelevision follows afewpatterns andstereotypes whenit comestoportrayingintelligence. Oneofthemost obvious andfranklypainful depictions ofintelligenceis thesociallyawkward genius. In spite of their high IQs and brilliant minds, these characters have trouble understanding jokes and other social cues. For instance, nearlyeverycharacter in “The Big BangTheory” acts this way. Most of the show’s humor comes from the contrast between the awkwardness of the brilliant physicists like Sheldon and Leonard, and the “normal” people like Penny, the waitress who lives across the hall.Another kind of intelligent character is theonewhoseabilitiesarelimitedtohelpingtheprotagonist.Wethuscanseethatintheshow“Arrow,”Felicity Smoak is a computer whiz who worked as an IT girl for superhero Oliver Queen’s company before joining “TeamArrow”asahacker.Shecoulddoanythingfromfindingshortcutsduringacarchasetosendingagreedy criminal’s illegally-earned income to a charity as a twisted form of blackmail—all from the comfort of her computerscreen.However,whenshewasn’tbusysavingtheworld,shewasreducedtolittlemorethanOliver Queen’sloveinterest.Thefinaltypeofsmartcharacteristheonethatisconstantlypickedon.Inahighschool scenario, it’s the nerdy kid who gets shoved into lockers and made fun of. The show “Glee” created an entire seriesbasedonthisidea.Evenafterthegleeclubwonawardsandcompetitions,itwasstillmetwithresentment from the majorityof the student body.Although the audience wanted the students in the glee club to succeed, the prevailing theme throughout the show was that the kids who were smart and hard-working were not the ones whowerecool and popular. Thefactis,smartpeoplearen’tasuniqueastelevisionmakesthemouttobe.Theyshouldnotbemarveled at like zoo animals or be used as an easy target. Additionally, the characters who are presented in the media shouldn’t have their intelligence be their defining characteristic.Although television has come a long way in normalizing intelligence, there is still more ground to be gained in creating characters that are complex and interesting—not just smart."
