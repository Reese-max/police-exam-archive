Also encouraging are the\nrecent shifts in government policy designed to attract more foreign professional and\ntechnical talent to Taiwan to contribute their know-how to the envisioned industrial\ntransformation. The rule about having two years of prior work experience to qualify to\nobtain a work permit has been made much more flexible, as have regulations on visa\neligibility and even on acquiring local citizenship without relinquishing one’s original\nnationality.",

We all know some people who have 16 IQs, but are successful in their work, social relationships, love lives, and in maintaining physical and mental well-being. They are much more successful than many people who have higher IQs. Why do “smart” people think “dumb,” and vice versa? The answer is that there is a second kind of intelligence that is unrelated to IQ tests, but is related, 17 , to social skills and coping with emotions. When people who are obviously bright get passed over for the key promotions or remain frustrated and unfulfilled in their family lives, they naturally ask, “Where did I go wrong?” They try to figure out where they went wrong intellectually, but that is not where the problem 18 . Although a high IQ does contribute to success in many life endeavors, it is far from the whole story, or even the most important part. A high IQ equips us to learn from books and lectures, but it does not ensure that we know how to 19 practical lessons from experience. That requires an altogether different type of intelligence. In fact, we have two “minds” operating all the time. Besides our rational intelligence, we have a second kind of intelligence, which IQ tests do not measure. It is experiential intelligence.
