Sixty-four-year-old Thai Ngoc, from central Quang Nam province in Vietnam, claims that he has not slept for 33 years! “My insomnia started many years ago after I got a fever. I have tried sleeping pills and Vietnamese traditional medicine, but nothing helps, not even to get me to sleep for a few minutes,” said Ngoc. But amazingly, despite 11,700 41 sleepless nights since then, he has never once been sick. “Fortunately, the insomnia doesn’t seem to have had a negative 42 on my health. I still feel healthy and can farm like other men. I even carry two 50-kilogram bags of fertilizer for four kilometers every day.” 43 his wife, when Ngoc went for a medical checkup recently, his doctor said he was in perfect health except for a minor 44 in liver function. Ngoc lives with his six children on his farm at the foot of a mountain. He spends the day farming and taking care of his pigs and chickens, and at night he often does extra farm work or guards his farm to prevent theft. His neighbor Vu said that Ngoc volunteered to help beat a drum during the night and guard the house for the relatives of the dead during 45 ceremonies so that they could take a nap. Vu also said that when the villagers were planting sugar cane, several people asked Ngoc to be their “alarm clock” and wake them up early in the morning to go to work as he was up anyway.",

The industries basically combine arts, culture, business and technology. In Europe, the United Kingdom owns the hugest amount of creative sectors owing to the active and effective promotion of the government. With its excellent track record, the UK is regarded as a pioneer and a world leader in sustaining the development of creative and cultural industries. According to the UK’s definition, the creative and cultural industries generally refer to those industries that rely on original creativity, expertise and talent and have the capacity to generate wealth and jobs by means of the advancement of intellectual property.

Pi Li International with its incorporation of multimedia has remarkably converted itself from a traditional puppet theatre troupe into a modern and flourishing venture. While still adhering to the original puppet show philosophy, Pi Li has in effect woven the modern and contemporary culture into the puppet show tradition so nicely that it has become a great success in the creative industry. Pi Li’s innovative commercialization of traditional culture has received much admiration as well as an excellent model for related industries to imitate. In 2002, Pi Li was also certified by the Government Information Office as part of an “important emerging industry,” recognizing its significant role in the creative and cultural industries.
