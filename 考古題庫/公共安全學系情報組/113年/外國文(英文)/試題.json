International fraud encompasses a wide range of\ndeceptive practices,including identity theft, moneylaundering,investment\nscams, and cyber fraud. These schemes often involve complex networks\nof individuals and organizations operating in multiple jurisdictions,\nmaking it challenging for law enforcement agencies to investigate and\nprosecute offenders effectively.\nIn a world where borders are increasingly porous, combating international\nfraud demands a proactive and unified approach. To effectively combat\ninternational fraud, there is an urgent need for enhanced international\ncooperation, harmonized legal frameworks, increased resource allocation,\nand the development of innovative strategies that can keep pace with\nevolving criminal tactics.",
