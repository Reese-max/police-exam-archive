These daily rhythms are not simply a response to the 24-hour changes in the physical environment imposed by the earth turning on its axis but, instead, arise from a timekeeping system within the organism. This timekeeping system, or biological “clock,” allows the organism to anticipate and prepare for the changes in the physical environment that are associated with day and night, thereby ensuring that the organism will “do the right thing” at the right time of the day. The synchrony of an organism with both its external and internal environments is critical to the organism’s well-being and survival; a lack of synchrony between the organism and the external environment may lead to the individual’s immediate demise. For example, if a nocturnal rodent were to venture from its burrow during broad daylight, the rodent would be exceptionally easy prey for other animals. Similarly, a lack of synchrony within the internal environment might lead to health problems in the individual, such as those associated with jet lag, shift work, and the accompanying sleep loss. The mechanisms underlying the biological timekeeping systems and the potential consequences of their failure are among the issues addressed by researchers in the field of chronobiology. Although no single experiment serves as the defining event from which to date the beginning of modern research in chronobiology, studies conducted in the 1950s on circadian rhythmicity in fruit flies and in humans can be considered its foundation. The area of sleep research, which also is subsumed under the field of chronobiology, evolved somewhat independently, with the identification of various sleep stages around the same time.",
