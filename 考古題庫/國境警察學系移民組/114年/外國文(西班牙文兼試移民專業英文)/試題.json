A diferencia de\nTrump, quien mantuvo la conversación de dos horas desde la Oficina Oval y\nadelantó la llamada con mayúsculas en redes sociales, Putin no tenía libre su\nagenda. Llamó desde una escuela para niños superdotados en el balneario de\nSochi, en el mar Negro, y le hizo un hueco a Trump durante un recorrido por\nlas instalaciones.\nDespués,quedó claro quecada uno consideró lallamada con diferentes niveles\nde importancia. Mientras Trump proclamó en una publicación optimista en\nredes sociales que la llamada “salió muy bien” y que Rusia y Ucrania habían\nacordado “iniciar negociaciones inmediatas para un cese del fuego”, Putin\ndejó claro en sus propios comentarios que no cedía en sus exigencias\nmaximalistas de poner fin a la violencia.
