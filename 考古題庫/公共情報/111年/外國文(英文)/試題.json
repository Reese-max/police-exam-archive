These colleges tend to be underfunded and suffer from high dropout rates. This investment program could be combined with targeted debt forgiveness for those college graduates(and especially non-graduates)unabletorepaytheirloans. When Iheard this week that Elizabeth Warren was instead proposing a sweepingdebt-relief program, I was disappointed. Her campaign has been full of ideas to reduce poverty and lift middle-class living standards. A big debt-cancellation program is much less progressive than most of her ideas.
